    <h2>Range Rover Review</h2> 
    <h3>Year:   2020</h3>
    <h3>Make:   Land Rover</h3>
    <h3>Model:  Range Rover</h3>
    <p>Automakers typically redesign their vehicles every five to six years. But push the life cycle longer, and they run the 
        risk of having an overly dated product.

        Land Rover hasn't fully redesigned its Range Rover Sport since the 2014 model year. Compared to some newer luxury SUVs 
        
        (including some even in Land Rover's own lineup), the Sport might come across as a little dated. Thankfully, 
        there have been enough recent updates to keep the 2020 Range Rover Sport a viable pick.
        
        The Sport may be an old-timer, but it looks just as fresh as the brand's newer SUVs. Credit is due in part to a significant 
        refresh in 2018 that updated the interior with a new infotainment system, a secondary touchscreen for the climate controls, 
        and more. And late last year, Land Rover swapped out the previous supercharged V6 engine for a new turbocharged inline-six 
        engine. This engine, thanks to a mild hybrid system, 
        is more fuel-efficient while still maintaining a robust amount of power.</p>
