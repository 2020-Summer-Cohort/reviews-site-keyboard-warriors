        Automakers typically redesign their vehicles every five to six years.
        But push the life cycle longer, and they run the risk of having an
        overly dated product. Land Rover hasn't fully redesigned its Range Rover
        Sport since the 2014 model year. Compared to some newer luxury SUVs
        (including some even in Land Rover's own lineup), the Sport might come
        across as a little dated. Thankfully, there have been enough recent
        updates to keep the 2020 Range Rover Sport a viable pick. The Sport may
        be an old-timer, but it looks just as fresh as the brand's newer SUVs.
        Credit is due in part to a significant refresh in 2018 that updated the
        interior with a new infotainment system, a secondary touchscreen for the
        climate controls, and more. And late last year, Land Rover swapped out
        the previous supercharged V6 engine for a new turbocharged inline-six
        engine. This engine, thanks to a mild hybrid system, is more
        fuel-efficient while still maintaining a robust amount of power.
