      <h2>Porsche Review</h2>
      <h3>Year: 2020</h3>
      <h3>Make: Porsche</h3>
      <h3>Model: 911</h3>

        Although the 2020 Porsche 911 kicks off a new generation — code-named
        992 — it isn't wildly different from its 991 predecessor. If you want
        that from your next sports car, Chevrolet will be happy to sell you a
        mid-engine C8 Corvette. But the redesigned 2020 911 is more than up to
        the challenge of subtly evolving Porsche's rear-engine icon. This new
        911 picks up right where the old model left off by pairing
        supercar-adjacent performance with everyday drivability. For now,
        Porsche is offering just the Carrera and Carrera S versions, plus the
        all-wheel-drive 4 and 4S versions. Engine horsepower is up slightly, and
        the PDK automatic transmission now sports an extra gear. Bored with the
        idea of just a "regular" Carrera? Just as the sun sets in the west, you
        can bet that Porsche has its typical buffet of Turbos and GT3s queued up
        in the pipeline for future model years.
