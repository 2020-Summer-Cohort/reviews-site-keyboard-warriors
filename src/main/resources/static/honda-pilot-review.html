    <p>You have more choices than ever for a three-row midsize SUV, yet the Honda Pilot, a mainstay of the class, 
        remains one of the best choices available. You'll enjoy roomy seating for up to eight, a quiet interior and a 
        comfortable ride quality. The plush accommodations don't come at the expense of performance either since the Pilot is 
        surprisingly capable when driven on twisty roads. And while we're not totally enamored with the optional nine-speed 
        automatic transmission, 
        there's no doubt the standard V6 has plenty of power to move this large crossover.</p>
