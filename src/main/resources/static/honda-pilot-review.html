        You have more choices than ever for a three-row midsize SUV, yet the
        Honda Pilot, a mainstay of the class, remains one of the best choices
        available. You'll enjoy roomy seating for up to eight, a quiet interior
        and a comfortable ride quality. The plush accommodations don't come at
        the expense of performance either since the Pilot is surprisingly
        capable when driven on twisty roads. And while we're not totally
        enamored with the optional nine-speed automatic transmission, there's no
        doubt the standard V6 has plenty of power to move this large crossover.
