    <h2>Chevy Corvette Review</h2> 
    <h3>Year:   2020</h3>
    <h3>Make:   Chevrolet</h3>
    <h3>Model:  Corvette</h3>
    <h3>Hashtag: </h3>
    <p>For 2020, the Corvette has undergone the most radical redesign in its 67-year history. Believing that they had squeezed every ounce of performance they could from the Corvette's classic front-engine and rear-drive layout, Chevrolet's engineers decided a new mid-engine layout was the way to go for its inherent advantages in weight distribution. Risky? Yes. But the result is hugely impressive.

        In terms of performance, the Corvette equals or outshines cars costing twice to three times as much. The new 6.2-liter V8 and dual-clutch automatic transmission are a formidable combo on the track but offer plenty of oomph and smooth operation in nearly any condition. The 2020 Corvette also imparts more information about its handling balance and grip, thereby giving its driver more confidence in taking the car up to its handling limits.</p>
