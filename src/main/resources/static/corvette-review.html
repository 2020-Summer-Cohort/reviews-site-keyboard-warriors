        For 2020, the Corvette has undergone the most radical redesign in its
        67-year history. Believing that they had squeezed every ounce of
        performance they could from the Corvette's classic front-engine and
        rear-drive layout, Chevrolet's engineers decided a new mid-engine layout
        was the way to go for its inherent advantages in weight distribution.
        Risky? Yes. But the result is hugely impressive. In terms of
        performance, the Corvette equals or outshines cars costing twice to
        three times as much. The new 6.2-liter V8 and dual-clutch automatic
        transmission are a formidable combo on the track but offer plenty of
        oomph and smooth operation in nearly any condition. The 2020 Corvette
        also imparts more information about its handling balance and grip,
        thereby giving its driver more confidence in taking the car up to its
        handling limits.
